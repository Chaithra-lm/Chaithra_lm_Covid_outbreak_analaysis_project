Machine Learning- Linear Regression Project

Dataset used: Covid Cases data fetched by Johns Hopkins University

Dataset

The dataset retrieved from the official repository of Johns Hopkins University³.
This data consists of daily case reports and daily time series summary tables.
In the study, we have selected time-series summary tables in CSV format having
three tables for confirmed, death, and recovered cases of COVID-19 with six properties. 
For example, province/state, country/region, last update, confirmed, death, and recovered cases.

Prediction and Analysis

Coronavirus spread has conducted the society under the edge of loss in social lives.
Additionally, it is crucial to investigate the transmission growth ahead and predict 
the future occurrences of the transmission. In concurrent, state-of-the-art mathematical 
models are chosen based on machine learning for a computational process to predict the spread of the virus, for instance:

Support Vector Regression⁵ (SVR)
Polynomial Regression⁶ (PR)
Deep Learning regression models

Concpets used to plot the graph : Regression analysis, Linear-regression, Some of the Machine Learning Concepts, Correlation coefficients
editor used: Google colab
lanaguge used: Python, modules and libraries
